  <h1 style="text-align:center">Software Development Process</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center">The software development process refers to the method via which an individual or a team design and builds a software, 
	from its initial planning phase to its implementation or delivery to the client. The process either follows a straight-forward method of tackling
	problems, known as the waterfall model, or it follows the newer and more versatile method called agile software development. Whichever method is 
	used, the core concepts and steps remain more or less the same. The steps are: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Requirements/ data gathering</li>
		<li>Planning and design</li>
		<li>Implement the code</li>
		<li>Test the program</li>
		<li>Maintain the software</li>
	</ul>
	<p>All of these steps together are called the software development process.</p>
</p>

   <h1 style="text-align:center">Importance of Software Design</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center">Software design is the process via which the client requirements and demands are turned into a plan to build a functioning program. 
   In this stage of the software development process, programmers have to plan and figure out how they can respond to client requirements. 
   This stage is necessary to make sure the resulting software is high-quality and user-friendly. The more thought-out and detailed the 
   design stage is, the less errors the final product will have. </p>
 
  <h1 style="text-align:center">Personally Observed Software: Clip Studio Paint Mobile</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center">The software that comes to my mind when I think of something “designed well” is Clip Studio Paint Mobile. It’s an illustration app designed
  for smartphones and tablet. The most important thing that stands out to me is how optimized the app is compared to other similar app on mobile, 
  even on older hardware. The app rarely lags. It has both a simple mode for beginners and studio mode for advanced users. The simple mode is easy 
  on the eyes while the studio mode has all the functions a professional may need. The app also lets you save, work and export your files in multiple
  different formats, which allow for a more versatile workflow. The app is a prime example of a software designed specifically to meet its userbase’s 
  demands. </p>
  <h1 style="text-align:center">Requirement Gathering: Process and Importance</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center">Requirement or data gathering is the first and most important process in the software development process. This step gives
	  a clear view of the demands of the clients and helps to establish a plan for the entirety of the development process. To start gathering the requirements,
	  the developer or the company must ask the clients about their needs using clear and precise questions. The requirements gathered should clearly define the
	  users, their needs and the actions taken by the application to satisfy those need. It should also be categorized based on their importance and priority and
	  must be written in a simple but well-organized way. Without a clear understanding of this step, the developed software may turn out to be lacking or perhaps
	  even entirely unfit to fulfil the demands of the client. As such, it’s important to be aware of the needs of the clients and gather requirements accordingly.
  </p>
  <h1 style="text-align:center">User Stories: Clip Studio Paint Mobile</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center">The app I had mentioned previously was Clip Studio Paint Mobile. Five user stories related to the app are given below:
<ul>
	<li> As an artist, I want a brush category, so that I can categorize and organize my brushes</li>
<li> As an artist, I want a liquify tool, so that I can shift and move around parts of the artwork without changing the layer contents. </li>
	<li> As an animator, I want a timeline function, so that I can see the frames and timing of the animation clearly. </li>
	<li> As an editor, I want a text wrap tool, so that I can fit the text to various objects and elements in the picture. </li>
	<li> As an animator, I want an onion-skin function, so that I can observe the placements of my previous and next frames. </li>
</ul>
 </p>
<h1 style="text-align:center">Empathy In Business Models</h1>
<p style="text-align:center">The 3 key elements of empathy are as follows: -
<ul>
<li>Emotion- Marketing and design professionals have historically prioritized cognitive aspects over emotions. However, there has been a shift in recent years. Don Norman, a renowned cognitive scientist in design, authored "Emotional Design," emphasizing the need to understand customers' emotions akin to self-understanding. Cognitive science now acknowledges emotions in understanding human behavior and design.</li>
<li>Culture & Context- Humans naturally attribute meaning to their experiences, including product use in different contexts. A cultural shift in social sciences has emphasized culture, meaning, and context, extending to business and design. Understanding culture and context is now vital for success and product development. Kimberly-Clark's research highlights the importance of context in design. Businesses increasingly invest in understanding customer lifestyles, reflecting a broader industry trend.</li>
</ul>	
<p style="text-align:center">The 3 business models, their problems and relation to each element are given below:
<ul>
<li>Sheep- The move from customers to consumers altered market dynamics, putting more emphasis on how organizations interact with their clients. This idea that customers are passive led to marketing emphasis, which is now being contested by consumers with knowledge. It prevents true empathy since it is disrespectful to customers. This model lacks culture as it primarily discusses the shift from customers to consumers and how it affected market dynamics, potentially hindering empathy and respect for customers.</li>
<li>Homo Economicus- Modern business practices, influenced by economics, often assume individuals are "homo economicus," prioritizing quantitative metrics like ROI, features, and units sold over product use and quality, leading to impractical products. This model puts emphasis on metrics and ROI which can sometimes overlook the broader contextual factors that influence customer behavior and product success.</li> 
<li>The Human Factor- Early consumer models were not behavior-focused. The "tasks and goals" strategy, which is based on "human factors" and cognitive science, concentrates on efficiency while often overlooking the whole scope of the customer experience. This model lacks emotion since it frequently prioritizes product effectiveness over the customer experience.</li>	
</ul></p>
<h1 style="text-align:center">The iPod</h1>
<p style="text-align:center">The iPod was a small pocket-sized media player developed and released by Apple in competition to the more bulkier media players available at that time. 
	While it only offered basic functionalities such as browsing, playing and rating audio files, Apple paired it up with iTunes and iTunes Music store which later boosted it’s popularity by a large margin. 
	While it’s small size was certainly a factor for it’s appeal, what made the device truly fascinating was the entire system supporting it. 
	From acquiring audio files to transferring them to your iPod, Apple made sure to streamline the entire process enough to make it appealing to the general public, hence its success. </p>
