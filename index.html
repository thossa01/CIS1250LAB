  <h1 style="text-align:center">Software Development Process</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center">The software development process refers to the method via which an individual or a team design and builds a software, 
	from its initial planning phase to its implementation or delivery to the client. The process either follows a straight-forward method of tackling
	problems, known as the waterfall model, or it follows the newer and more versatile method called agile software development. Whichever method is 
	used, the core concepts and steps remain more or less the same. The steps are: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Requirements/ data gathering</li>
		<li>Planning and design</li>
		<li>Implement the code</li>
		<li>Test the program</li>
		<li>Maintain the software</li>
	</ul>
	<p>All of these steps together are called the software development process.</p>
</p>

   <h1 style="text-align:center">Importance of Software Design</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center">Software design is the process via which the client requirements and demands are turned into a plan to build a functioning program. 
   In this stage of the software development process, programmers have to plan and figure out how they can respond to client requirements. 
   This stage is necessary to make sure the resulting software is high-quality and user-friendly. The more thought-out and detailed the 
   design stage is, the less errors the final product will have. </p>
 
  <h1 style="text-align:center">Personally Observed Software: Clip Studio Paint Mobile</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center">The software that comes to my mind when I think of something “designed well” is Clip Studio Paint Mobile. It’s an illustration app designed
  for smartphones and tablet. The most important thing that stands out to me is how optimized the app is compared to other similar app on mobile, 
  even on older hardware. The app rarely lags. It has both a simple mode for beginners and studio mode for advanced users. The simple mode is easy 
  on the eyes while the studio mode has all the functions a professional may need. The app also lets you save, work and export your files in multiple
  different formats, which allow for a more versatile workflow. The app is a prime example of a software designed specifically to meet its userbase’s 
  demands. </p>
  <h1 style="text-align:center">Requirement Gathering: Process and Importance</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center">Requirement or data gathering is the first and most important process in the software development process. This step gives
	  a clear view of the demands of the clients and helps to establish a plan for the entirety of the development process. To start gathering the requirements,
	  the developer or the company must ask the clients about their needs using clear and precise questions. The requirements gathered should clearly define the
	  users, their needs and the actions taken by the application to satisfy those need. It should also be categorized based on their importance and priority and
	  must be written in a simple but well-organized way. Without a clear understanding of this step, the developed software may turn out to be lacking or perhaps
	  even entirely unfit to fulfil the demands of the client. As such, it’s important to be aware of the needs of the clients and gather requirements accordingly.
  </p>
  <h1 style="text-align:center">User Stories: Clip Studio Paint Mobile</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center">The app I had mentioned previously was Clip Studio Paint Mobile. Five user stories related to the app are given below:
<ul>
	<li> As an artist, I want a brush category, so that I can categorize and organize my brushes</li>
<li> As an artist, I want a liquify tool, so that I can shift and move around parts of the artwork without changing the layer contents. </li>
	<li> As an animator, I want a timeline function, so that I can see the frames and timing of the animation clearly. </li>
	<li> As an editor, I want a text wrap tool, so that I can fit the text to various objects and elements in the picture. </li>
	<li> As an animator, I want an onion-skin function, so that I can observe the placements of my previous and next frames. </li>
</ul>
 </p>
<h1 style="text-align:center">Empathy In Business Models</h1>
<p style="text-align:center">The 3 key elements of empathy are as follows: -
<ul>
<li>Emotion- Marketing and design professionals have historically prioritized cognitive aspects over emotions. However, there has been a shift in recent years. Don Norman, a renowned cognitive scientist in design, authored "Emotional Design," emphasizing the need to understand customers' emotions akin to self-understanding. Cognitive science now acknowledges emotions in understanding human behavior and design.</li>
<li>Culture & Context- Humans naturally attribute meaning to their experiences, including product use in different contexts. A cultural shift in social sciences has emphasized culture, meaning, and context, extending to business and design. Understanding culture and context is now vital for success and product development. Kimberly-Clark's research highlights the importance of context in design. Businesses increasingly invest in understanding customer lifestyles, reflecting a broader industry trend.</li>
</ul>	
<p style="text-align:center">The 3 business models, their problems and relation to each element are given below:
<ul>
<li>Sheep- The move from customers to consumers altered market dynamics, putting more emphasis on how organizations interact with their clients. This idea that customers are passive led to marketing emphasis, which is now being contested by consumers with knowledge. It prevents true empathy since it is disrespectful to customers. This model lacks culture as it primarily discusses the shift from customers to consumers and how it affected market dynamics, potentially hindering empathy and respect for customers.</li>
<li>Homo Economicus- Modern business practices, influenced by economics, often assume individuals are "homo economicus," prioritizing quantitative metrics like ROI, features, and units sold over product use and quality, leading to impractical products. This model puts emphasis on metrics and ROI which can sometimes overlook the broader contextual factors that influence customer behavior and product success.</li> 
<li>The Human Factor- Early consumer models were not behavior-focused. The "tasks and goals" strategy, which is based on "human factors" and cognitive science, concentrates on efficiency while often overlooking the whole scope of the customer experience. This model lacks emotion since it frequently prioritizes product effectiveness over the customer experience.</li>

<h1 style="text-align:center">The iPod</h1>
<p style="text-align:center">The iPod was a small pocket-sized media player developed and released by Apple in competition to the more bulkier media players available at that time. 
	While it only offered basic functionalities such as browsing, playing and rating audio files, Apple paired it up with iTunes and iTunes Music store which later boosted it’s popularity by a large margin. 
	While it’s small size was certainly a factor for it’s appeal, what made the device truly fascinating was the entire system supporting it. 
	From acquiring audio files to transferring them to your iPod, Apple made sure to streamline the entire process enough to make it appealing to the general public, hence its success. </p>

<h1 style="text-align:center">Prototyping</h1>
<p>Prototyping in software design means creating mock designs of a product before finalizing it. The selected mock design is then showed to the client for their approval. If the 
	client is satisfied with it, the design can then move on to the final stages. Otherwise, the prototype is changed, refined and redesigned to fit the client’s needs. The uses
	of prototyping in software design are many, with one of the main reasons being the ability to change something in case the feature in question doesn’t meet the client’s 
	wishes. As the client is involved in the process, they can feel as if they are contributing and the developers can fine-tune the design to the client’s exact needs, so it 
	makes designing the product easier and more convenient. In other words, prototyping is:</p>
	<ul>
	<li> Fast to produce</li>
	<li> Cheaper or easier to produce and  </li>
	<li> Involves the client more into the project than designing the final product outright.</li>
	</ul>
<p>It’s a necessary process and thus, all good software designers should have adequate knowledge about it. One of the ways of prototyping is making a paper prototype. To make a 
	paper prototype, one first needs some basic materials such as pencil, paper, eraser, cardboard etc., all of which are available almost everywhere for cheap. The developer 
	will then draw or show the design on paper and ask for client feedback. Once the client gives their approval, the developer can then move on to designing the actual software
	instead.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center">Commmunication in Software Design</h1>
<p>To design a good software, one needs to understand what their clients want from the product. The designer needs to understand the clients’ requirements, needs, features etc to 
	deliver a good final software. And for that, communication is essential. Only through clear communication between all parties involved can the designer create a product that
	satisfies all the requirement. Not just that, clear communication is vital among the team for avoiding conflict and collision of interest. It makes teamwork easier and helps
	make the development process faster. All in all, it is an absolutely essential part of designing a software.</p>
	<p>Three key elements of communication are given below:</p>
<ul>
	<li> Be flexible: Learn to accept changes and be accommodating to new ideas </li>
	<li> Be honest: Provide honest feedback and voice one’s feelings truly. </li>
	<li> Learn to listen: To give attention to what the client or one’s team member is trying to convey</li>
	</ul>
	<p>During my high school, I had a few opportunities to lead different groups and clubs. During that time, conflict had risen a couple of times due to my inability to be 
		flexible enough to accommodate all members of the groups and their needs. If I had learned to be more flexible, perhaps I could have created an environment that 
		let everyone flourish. It is something I will keep in mind going forward.</p>
	<h1 style="text-align:center">Affordance in Software Design</h1>
	<p>I have decided to explain “Affordance”, one of the design principles described in the lectures, for this assignment.</p>
	<p>Affordance in design refers to the qualities or aspects of an object that allow individuals to understand how to use it intuitively. It is a necessary part of software 
		design because it determines how easily users can navigate and interact with an application or system without direct guidelines. It is about designing interfaces 
		that explain their own use and make clear of their capabilities. Affordance directly impacts user experience. Good affordance decreases confusion, lowers the 
		learning curve and makes the overall experience pleasant. It can make a complex system appear simple to its users. The two examples of affordance I can think of 
		are:</p>
	<ul>
	<li> Using underlined texts to highlight hyperlinks. This helps the user to identify where to click and differentiate between normal texts and web links. </li>
	<li> Using aggressive colors like red to mark warnings and important notices. This helps the viewer to immediately take note of the notice and keep it in mind. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>In other words, affordance can be a factor in making or breaking a user’s experience of a product or site. Even if the product itself is highly innovative and exemplary,
		a bad design may end up isolating the user and thus make them not want to use it anymore. As such, affordance is one of the most important principles when it comes 
		to designing.</p>
	<h1 style="text-align:center">Deceptive Ads</h1>
	<p>The deceptive design pattern "Disguised Ads" contravenes multiple principles of the ACM's Code of Ethics, highlighting significant ethical concerns in digital design:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>	Contribute to Society and Human Well-being:
			Disguised adverts compromise user autonomy and wellbeing by tricking users into clicking on adverts masquerading as legitimate content. The idea of 
			leveraging computing expertise to improve society and uphold individual rights is broken by this approach, which puts profit above societal good. ‏
		</li>
		<li>	Avoid Harm:
			These advertisements may expose users inadvertently to hazardous materials or security hazards like phishing. Disguised advertisements violate the ethical duty 
			to prevent major and unfair negative effects by creating unwarranted harm through deceit.
		</li>
		<li>	Be Honest and Trustworthy:
			Integrating advertisements with authentic content violates the principles of integrity and openness, which are critical to computing reliability. 
			The concept of complete openness and transparency is flagrantly broken when users are deceived about the nature of the content.
		</li>
		<li>	Be Fair and Take Action Not to Discriminate:
			Certain groups, such the elderly or those with less digital knowledge, may be disproportionately affected by this dishonest tendency, which could 
			result in unjust exploitation. This can provide these users an unfair experience, which is against the concepts of justice and nondiscrimination.
		</li>
		
	</ul>
