  <h1 style="text-align:center">Software Development Process</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center">The software development process refers to the method via which an individual or a team design and builds a software, 
	from its initial planning phase to its implementation or delivery to the client. The process either follows a straight-forward method of tackling
	problems, known as the waterfall model, or it follows the newer and more versatile method called agile software development. Whichever method is 
	used, the core concepts and steps remain more or less the same. The steps are:
	<ul>
		<li>Requirements/ data gathering</li>
		<li>Planning and design</li>
		<li>Implement the code</li>
		<li>Test the program</li>
		<li>Maintain the software</li>
	</ul>
	All of these steps together are called the software development process.

   <h1 style="text-align:center">Importance of Software Design</h1>
  <p>Software design is the process via which the client requirements and demands are turned into a plan to build a functioning program. 
   In this stage of the software development process, programmers have to plan and figure out how they can respond to client requirements. 
   This stage is necessary to make sure the resulting software is high-quality and user-friendly. The more thought-out and detailed the 
   design stage is, the less errors the final product will have. </p>
 
  <h1 style="text-align:center">Personally Observed Software: Clip Studio Paint Mobile</h1>
  <p>The software that comes to my mind when I think of something “designed well” is Clip Studio Paint Mobile. It’s an illustration app designed
  for smartphones and tablet. The most important thing that stands out to me is how optimized the app is compared to other similar app on mobile, 
  even on older hardware. The app rarely lags. It has both a simple mode for beginners and studio mode for advanced users. The simple mode is easy 
  on the eyes while the studio mode has all the functions a professional may need. The app also lets you save, work and export your files in multiple
  different formats, which allow for a more versatile workflow. The app is a prime example of a software designed specifically to meet its userbase’s 
  demands. </p>
